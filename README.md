# Portfolio, Day 2

Your task today: "Mock-up In Markup!"

Build out a wireframe for your portfolio in HTML and CSS only:

- Make a repo and clone it
- Do your work on a non-master branch with a good descriptive name
- For now, do ONLY your mobile CSS. So when working on this, use a narrow window or view in one of the mobile emulators in the dev tools
- Only use generic placeholder data for now; think about how much content you have now and also how much you'll have at the end of the course
